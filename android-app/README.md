This directory is a placeholder for your Android application.

To add your Android project:
1. Copy your entire Android Studio project into this folder or move the project folder here.
2. Do NOT commit `local.properties` or your release keystore file.
3. Add Android-specific CI later if desired (GitHub Actions template available).
